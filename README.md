# DRF-Project
Uses 2 models Cars and Category. There are several view classes that use permission_classes, there are 2 personal permissions classes, but these have since been replaced by base permissions. Also a custom router was used, but was later replaced because tokens were used (JWT, Token-based, Session-based).
